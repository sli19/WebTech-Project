        <h3>Seville, Spain. January 2019 - May 2019.</h3>
        <p>
            During the spring semester of my third year in college, I had the opportunity to take a semester abroad in
            Seville, Spain.
            I chose Seville for the language, the culture, and the unbelievable weather. I had a very strategic plan to
            skip the winter storms in Boston. Prior to going, I spoke to students that had completed the program
            previously and people that had traveled to Seville on vacation. What I heard seemed too good to be true.
            Everyone was ecstatic about their experience! The most common response I got to the question "How was
            Sevilla, what did you do?" was "How much do you have because I can go on for days!" That said, I went into
            the semester with the mindset of not setting expectations based on how amazing other people's experiences
            were. I did not want to be disappointed...
            <br> <br> 
            **Insert images slideshow here**
            <br> <br>
            Little did I know, I would have the exact same response to that question today. Fast forward 5 months, 23
            cities, 12 countries, and 2 continents later, my semester came to an end. My time in Spain felt surreal. I
            was so busy traveling and meeting new people that I had not stopped for a minute to take it all in and
            reflect. I had so many firsts, walked so many streets and encountered so many people that I may never see
            again.
            <br>
            As I sat on the plane home, I wrote the following message:
            <hr>
        </p>
        <p class="writing1">
            A state of bliss, <br>
            when time passes faster than our ability to comprehend it, <br>
            everything outside our immediate surrounding becomes almost irrelevant, <br>
            a conscious state yet surprisingly unreal the moment we ‘snap out of it’. <br>

            We find these moments in the hobbies we love, people we love, and places that continuously mesmerize us.
            <br>
            We forget the constant intervals of time we invented for ourselves. <br>
            We let go of our list of everything wrong in our lives. <br>
            We say “no pasa nada” for the time being because we believe everything is presently ok. <br>
            These moments come and go, but above all else, I think a lot of us have come to recognize and appreciate
            them. <br>
            Thank you for the unforgettable moments of bliss, Europe. <br>
            You’ve changed my life by adding so much more to it.❤️ <br>
