      <h3>Shanghai, China. May 2018 - August 2018.</h3>
      <p>
        Ever wondered what it would be like to live and work in Shanghai? I was
        curious as well. Until I accepted an opportunity to intern in the heart
        of the Financial District (PuDong) in Shanghai. <br />
        Although I looked the part and spoke the language, working in Shanghai
        took some getting used to. My daily commutes to and from work were as
        you would expect, packed! I honestly felt like I didn't need to walk.
        The force of everyone moving in the same direction will carry me into
        the metro. Granted, I was there during the hottest months of the year
        where the temperature stayed above 35 degrees for weeks at a time.
        <br />
        Traffic hour complaints aside, Shanghai is amazing! The city is so
        vibrant and unique. All the "lights, camera, action" draws you in and
        you feel like you are on the set of a movie that is your own life. When
        the sun goes down, the financial district lights up (metaphorically and
        literally). It is so satisfying to walk out of the office past sunset,
        look up at the embellished buildings, look around at the locals and
        tourists roaming the city, and breath in the scent of capitalism. What a
        beautiful city. <br />

      <p>
        Let's talk about food! I grew up eating spicy Chinese food and my
        favourite food is hotpot. Imagine my excitment to be back in China for 4
        months and have unlimited access to Chinese food! The highlight of my
        time in Shanghai was definitely the amount of Chinese food and bubble
        tea I consumed. As one of the biggest and most internationally
        recognized cities in China, you can find any kind of food from every
        corner of China and beyond.
