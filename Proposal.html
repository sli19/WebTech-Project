    <h1>**Project Proposal**</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>What is your website about?</h3>
    <p>
        My website will be a personal website that highlights my travels and my artworks.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the objective of your website? (why is it important)</h3>
    <p>
        I have had the opportunity to travel quite extensively from a young age and 
        especially while I was abroad. I also like to draw the places I go to. Hopefully,
        this website will be an opportunity for me to share my experiences and some photos
        and drawings from these places. I hope this website can be entertaining and 
        informative for those looking to travel as well. 
    </p>

    <h3>Who is your target audience set?</h3>
    <P>
        Young adults who are interested in traveling, photography and art. <br>
        My target audience will also be people interested in learning about me. 
    </P>

    <h3>What content do you plan to include in each page of your website?</h3>
    <h4>Page 1</h4>
    <p>
        Homepage: <br>
        I will have a home page that outlines the other pages and content on the website. <br>
        This page will be very general, including photos and links to other pages. <br>
        I plan to have a page dedicated to the provinces I have traveled /lived in.
    </p>
    <h4>Page 2</h4>
    <p>
        Asia: <br>
        I was born in China. I want to highlight the two cities in China I have 
        spent significant amount of time in (Chongqing and Shanghai). I will also highlight 
        my trip to Japan and Korea. 
    </p>
    <h4>Page 3</h4>
    <p>
        North America: <br>
        I currently live in Canada and go to school in USA. I have some 
        recommendations, photos, and drawings for Canada and USA that I will share.
    </p>
    <h4>Page 4</h4>
    <p>
        Europe: <br>
        I studied abroad in Spain for a semester and had the opportunity to 
        travel around Europe. This page will be largely based on my abroad travels. 
    </p>
    <h4>Page 5</h4>
    <p>
        Contact Me: <br>
        The last page will be a page with some contact information and email link for people 
        that want to get in touch with me for whatever reason.
