        I chose to study at <a href="https://www.babson.edu/" target="_blank">Babson College</a> 
        because it has a great business program and I like the emphasis on entrepreneurship here. 
        Apart from the business courses offered at Babson, I was also drawn to the opportunities to 
        study abroad. When I visited Babson, my tourguide had talked about his experience on the BRIC program. 
        Although I did a different abroad program, I am really grateful for that experience. 
        I am currently a senior at Babson with concentrations in Economics and Finance. After graduation, 
        I hope to get a full time job in an industry that is challenging and interesting to me. My plans for 
        post-college are not set in stone yet as I am still in the recruitment process.

    <p> <!--this paragraph is about my interests. What I like to do in my free time.-->
        In my free time, I love to <a href="https://www.expedia.com/" target="_blank">travel</a>, 
        <a href="https://www.lpga.com/" target="_blank">golf</a>, and <a href="https://ago.ca/" target="_blank">draw</a>. 
        Since I was very little, I have been fortunate enough to be able to travel to many places around the world. 
        It is amazing to have the opportunity to experience a new culture, try new foods, and see the world from a new perspective. 
        Aside from traveling, I love to golf and draw. I find that both of these activities are very therapeutic for me in terms of 
        relieving stress. I have been golfing for over 10 years now and it is a sport I can continue to enjoy for 
        years to come. My interest in drawing sparked from my travels. My drawings are mostly landscape drawings of 
        places that I have traveled to and have resonated strongly with me.
