Shanghai

Ever wondered what it would be like to live and work in Shanghai? I was curious as well. Until I accepted an opportunity to intern in the heart of the Financial District (PuDong) in Shanghai. 
Although I looked the part and spoke the language, working in Shanghai took some getting used to. 
My daily commutes to and from work were as you would expect, packed! I honestly felt like I didn't need to walk. The force of everyone moving in the same direction will carry me into the metro. Granted, I was there during the hottest months of the year where the temperature stayed above 35 degrees for weeks at a time. 
Traffic hour complaints aside, Shanghai is amazing! The city is so vibrant and unique. All the "lights, camera, action" draws you in and you feel like you are on the set of a movie that is your own life. When the sun goes down, the financial district lights up (metaphorically and literally). It is so satisfying to walk out of the office past sunset, look up at the embellished buildings, look around at the locals and tourists enjoying roaming the city, and breath in the scent of capitalism. What a beautiful city. 

Let's talk about food! I grew up eating spicy Chinese food and my favourite food is hotpot. Imagine my excitment to be back in China for 4 months and have unlimited access to Chinese food! The highlight of my time in Shanghai was definitely the amount of Chinese food and bubble tea I consumed. As one of the biggest and most internationally recognized cities in China, you can find any kind of food from every corner of China and beyond.
